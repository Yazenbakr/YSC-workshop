# YSC-workshop
a workshop me and @Abdulrahman-Gamil worked on that began as a joke, but it turned into something amazing—a full-blown project we’re really proud of.

The idea behind this workshop was to promote Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions among Arab students, as there is a noticeable lack of Arab participation in the global CTF community. Our objective was to introduce students to what CTF is, explain how it works, and create a mini-competition with beginner-friendly challenges to help them grasp the concept and develop an interest in it—all within a 3-hour timeframe.

I’m proud to say we executed it perfectly. From start to finish, we handled everything ourselves: designing the slides, delivering the presentation, building a custom CTF hosting platform for participants, creating the challenges, and ensuring the event ran smoothly by providing support and hints to players during the competition.

The outcome was fantastic. The venue was packed, and the attendees were fully engaged, which reflected how well-crafted and intriguing the slides were. Many first-timers found the challenges difficult yet solvable, and it was rewarding to see them successfully tackle some of the problems. Overall, the results exceeded our expectations, and I’m thrilled with how everything turned out.

this repository will contain write-ups of the challenges, and the slides for future reference.
